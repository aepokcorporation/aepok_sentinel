Step 5.1: PQC TLS Transport Layer

Provides:
  - create_pqc_ssl_context(config) -> ssl.SSLContext
    Configures TLS 1.3, sets up PQC-hybrid group preference (X25519+Kyber).
    Enforces strict_transport fallback logic if desired.
  - connect_pqc_socket(config, hostname, port) -> a connected socket w/ PQC context
    Verifies the negotiated group, logs if fallback to classical occurred.

Assumptions:
  - We have a custom OQS-enabled OpenSSL build or an oqsprovider.so
  - .sentinelrc fields: strict_transport (bool), tls_mode (pqc-only, hybrid, classical),
    allowed_tls_groups, etc.
No forward references to future modules.
